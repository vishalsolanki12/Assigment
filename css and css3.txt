=>The biggest difference between CSS2 and CSS3 is that CSS3 is now split into different modules. Since each module makes its way through the W3C individually, 
there's a wider range of browser support. Make sure you test your CSS3 pages in as many browsers and operating systems as possible to ensure compatibility.

4.name a few css style components?

=>Properties: These are human-readable identifiers that indicate which stylistic features you want to modify. For example, font-size , width , background-color .

6.How can the background color of an element be changed?
=> To add background color in HTML, use the CSS background-color property. Set it to the color name or code you want and place 
   it inside a style attribute. Then add this style attribute to an HTML element, like a table, heading, div, or span tag

7.How can image repetition of the backup be controlled?
=> This task can be achieved by using the background-repeat property that will help us to control the repetition of the image.
   The background-repeat property in CSS is used to repeat the background image both horizontally and vertically. It also decides 
   whether the background image will be repeated or not.

8. What is the use of the background-position property?
=> Definition and Usage
	The background-position property sets the starting position of a background image. Tip: By default, a background-image is placed
     at the top-left corner of an element, and repeated both vertically and horizontally.

9. Which property controls the image scroll in the background?
=> In this article, we will discuss the property that is used to control the scrolling of an image in the background. The background-attachment 
   property in CSS is used to specify the kind of attachment of the background image with respect to its container. It can be set to scroll or
   make it remain fixed. It can be applied to all HTML elements.

	Syntax:

             background-attachment: scroll|fixed|local|initial|inherit;

	Ex.
		<!DOCTYPE html>
		<html>
		<head>
   		 <style>
        		#example {
            		    background-image:
			url("https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/geeks-25.png");
               	 background-position: center;
                	 background-repeat: no-repeat;
                	 background-attachment: scroll;
        }
   		 </style>
		 </head>
      
		<body style="text-align:center">
    		<h1 style="color:green">GeeksforGeeks</h1>
    		<h2> background-attachment: scroll;</h2><br><br>

10.Why should background and color be used as separate properties?
=> There are two reasons behind this: It enhances the legibility ofstyle sheets. The background property is a complex property in CSS,
   and if it is combined with color, the complexity will further increase.

11.There are two ways of centering block level elements:
=>
	1. By setting the properties margin-left and margin-right to auto and width to some explicit value:

	BODY {width: 30em; background: cyan;}
	P {width: 22em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto}

	In this case, the left and right margins will each be four ems wide, since they equally split up the eight ems left over from (30em - 22em).
     Note that it was not necessary to set an explicit width for the BODY element; it was done here to keep the math clean.

	Another example:

	TABLE {margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 400px;}
	In most legacy browsers, a table's width is by default determined by its content. In CSS-conformant browsers, the complete width of any element
     (including tables) defaults to the full width of its parent element's content area. As browser becaome more conformant,authors will need to be
     aware of the potential impact on their designs.

12.How to maintain the CSS specifications? 
=>     -Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media
       -World wide web consortium maintain the CSS specification.
       -They maintain css even the older  version to support the project which are mapping the old one.

13.What are the ways to integrate CSS as a web page
=> CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:

	Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements.
	Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section.
	External - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file.

14.What is embedded style sheets?
=> Embedded Stylesheet: It allows you to define styles for a particular HTML document as a whole in one place. This is done by embedding the <style></style>
   tags containing the CSS properties in the head of your document.

15.What are the external style sheets?
=> An external style sheet is a separate CSS file that can be accessed by creating a link within the head section of the webpage. Multiple webpages can use
   the same link to access the stylesheet. The link to an external style sheet is placed within the head section of the page.

16.What are the advantages and disadvantages of using external style sheets? 
=> The advantages of External Style Sheets are as follows :

   With the help of External Style Sheets, the styles of numerous documents can be organized from one single file.
   In External Style Sheets, Classes can be made for use on numerous HTML element types in many forms of the site.
   In complex contexts, Methods like selector and grouping can be implemented to apply styles.
   The disadvantages of External Style Sheets are as follows :

   An extra download is essential to import style information for each file.
   The execution of the file may be deferred till the external style sheet is loaded.
   While implementing style sheets, we need to test Web pages with multiple browsers in order to check compatibility issues

17. What is the meaning of the CSS selector?
=> A CSS selector is the first part of a CSS Rule. It is a pattern of elements and other terms that tell the browser which HTML elements should be selected to 
   have the CSS property values inside the rule applied to them.

18.What are the media types allowed by CSS?
=>

19.What is the rule set?
=> A collection of rules or signatures that network traffic or system activity is compared against to determine an action to takeâ€”such as forwarding or rejecting 
   a packet, creating an alert, or allowing a system event.
