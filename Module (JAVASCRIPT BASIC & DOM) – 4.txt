•    What is === operator?

     str = fread(file,flength(file) ; The function fwrite() is used to write the contents to the file.
     file = fopen("c:\MyFile.txt", 3);// opens the file for writing.

•    What are all the looping structures in JavaScript?
==>  for - loops through a block of code a number of times.
     for/in - loops through the properties of an object.
     for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object.
     while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true.

•    How can you convert the string of any base to an integer in JavaScript?
==>  To convert a string to an integer parseInt(), Number(), and Unary operator(+) function is used in javascript. parseInt() function returns Nan( not a number) when the string doesn't contain number. If a string with a number is sent, then only that number will be returned as the output.

•    How can a page be forced to load another page in JavaScript?
==>  In JavaScript, we can use window. location object to force a page to load another page. We can use the location object to set the URL of a new page.

==>  Event handlers attached to any DOM element are preserved.
     Replacement is done everywhere.
     It is not possible to append innerHTML.
     Breaks the document.
     Used for Cross-site Scripting.
